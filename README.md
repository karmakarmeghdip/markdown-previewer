# This is a Markdown Previewer.
        
 ## FYI, you can remove these boilerplate lines
        
 They're just so I can complete the requirements of [this project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer) .
        
  ```js 
        
  I used React.js, TailwindCSS and marked-react to build this.
        
  ``` 
        
 `Kinda cool once you think about it.`
        
 At first I just thought I'd make something quickly and get over with it.
        
 But as I was building this, I realized something.
        
  > Markdown editors are pretty dang cool
        
 So I figured that I'd actually put some effort into this.
        
 * I've completed basic functionality
        
 * Need to look at getting things to stay in the screen without overflowing
        
     * That means design stuff

 **Like what you see?** Then go ahead and start this project on my GitHub. 
        
 Go on, I won't look.
